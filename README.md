The main aim of the Bank Database Mnagement System is to keep track of customer transactions in the bank. 
We aim to demonstrate the use of create, read, update and delete MySQL operations through this project.

Branch employee creates customer account in the bank, then the customer can debit and credit amount and also check balance.
